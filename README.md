# TrackEasy

This is an Indoor Localization app which uses 3 or more than 3 Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons to locate the position of the user in a building.

After initially locating the user once in the builiding, the app tracks the movement of the user through an algorithm called Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR). 

PDR relies on the in built Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Sensors which give the orientation of the mobile phone. and measure the acceleration.
